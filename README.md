To run application at your local: 

### `npm start`

To run unit test at your local:

## Notes

### Why I chose to structure and write my code
+ break the component into container components & presentational components
+ following best practices of using redux

### What libraries or tools I used and why.
+ react-redux: manage the state of app
+ moment: manipulate and format datetime 
+ redux-promise: for asynchronous redux actions
+ jest, redux-mock-store & enzyme: for testing

###  Need to improve 
I have not enough time to finish following items:

+ add more several Unit Test & UI tests
+ to polish UI for look great
